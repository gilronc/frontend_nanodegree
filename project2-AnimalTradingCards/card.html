			<p>Gorillas live in groups called troops. Troops tend to be made of one adult male or silverback, multiple adult females and their offspring.However, multiple-male troops also exist.[33] A silverback is typically more than 12 years of age, and is named for the distinctive patch of silver hair on his back, which comes with maturity. Silverbacks also have large canine teeth that also come with maturity</p>
