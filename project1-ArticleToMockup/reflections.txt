Your response goes here!

I’ve actually been dabbling in web development for quite sometime, so I was familiar with the majority of HTML tags.  
 The new skills that I have learn’t is not really technical in nature, by submitting the first project, I know that I have finally come to a resolution to master the web’s frontend.  So my newest skill is a firm resolution to never give up and to always try new things.

Everything about the first project has been easy, it was a “walk in the park”.  

I’ve gotten a greater appreciation for the MDN network, I would definitely be reviewing all the HTML 5 tags.  Throughout my career, I’ve always skimmed past the contents of the MDN, this is the first time that I’m actually reading and understanding its power.
